In this study I will create a machine learning model to predict the weight of the fish based on the body measurement data of seven types of fish species. You can download the dataset from Kaggle. [Fish market](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market)
 
I am going to use Linear model from sklearn library. Since there are multiple features its **Multiple/Multivariate/Multi Variable Linear Regression** problem.
 
I have documented the code and tried to explain every important concept or library I have using during this study. I hope it will be helpful.

## To Do
* Work with the 'Ecommerce_Customer_Device_Usage.csv' file from the company. It has Customer info, such as Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:
  * Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
  * Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
  * Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
  * Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.

* The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
